    <h1>Setup</h1>
    <h2>Azure Configuration</h2>
    <h3>Create an App Registration</h3>
    <p>In order to configure the Sentinel app, a new App Registration in the Azure Portal is required.
        Please refer to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app#register-an-application">Register an Application</a> for
        further guidance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Sentinel SOAR App uses the client-credentials flow to authenticate against Azure. Under your created App registration, in Certificates & Secrets, create a new Client Secret.
      Save the secret value for later use during asset configuration.
    </p>

    <h3>Assign required Permissions to the App Registration</h3>
    <p>
      Under your subscription, select the <b>Add role assignment</b> context menu and assign the <i>Azure Sentinel Contributor</i> role to your registered app.
    </p>

    <h3>SOAR Configuration</h3>
    <p>
      When creating your SOAR asset, enter the Application ID as <b>Client ID</b> and the saved secret value as <b>Client Secret</b>.
    </p>
    <p>In order to connect to your Sentinel environment, the <b>Tenant ID</b>, <b>Subscription ID</b>, <b>Workspace Name</b>, <b>Workspace ID</b>, <b>Resource Group</b>
      fields are required. They can be found inside of the Azure Portal. Fields related to polling are optional.
    </p>

    <p>In order to retrieve the Workspace ID, navigate to your Sentinel Settings -> Workspace Settings</p>


    <h1>Usage</h1>
    <h2>How Sentinel handles identifiers</h2>
    <p>Actions like <b>get incident</b> take an <i>incident name</i> input parameter. This can be captured from the Sentinel API or Web UI, but it's not to be confused with the Incident Number or the Title.
      The Incident Name is the last component of the link to the incident that can be reviewed in Sentinel. For example, the Incident Name corresponding to
    </p>
    <p><code><pre>
      https://portal.azure.com/#asset/Microsoft_Azure_Security_Insights/Incident/subscriptions/dx582xwx-4x28-4f8d-9ded-9b0xd2803739/resourceGroups/demomachine_group/providers/Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/customworkspace/providers/Microsoft.SecurityInsights/Incidents/80289647-8743-4x67-87xx-9409x59xxxxx
    </pre></code>
    </p>

    <p>is simply 80289647-8743-4a67-87db-9409e597b0db</p>
    <h2>Run Query</h2>
    <h3>Timerange</h3>
    <p>The <b>timerange</b> parameter expects a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Durations">ISO 8061</a> duration. Please find some commonly used values below</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Last 7 days</b>: P7D</li>
      <li><b>Last 24 hours</b>: P1D</li>
      <li><b>Last 24 hours</b>: P1D</li>
      <li><b>Last 30 minutes:</b>: PT30M</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Post-Processing</h3>
    <p>The <b>run query</b> action will perform light post-processing of the raw results from Sentinel to ease the use of data within SOAR. Notable, it will aggregate all returned tables in a single
    result set and set the <i>SentinelTableName</i> property on the individual objects. Most of the time, there will only be a <i>PrimaryResult</i> table returned.</p>
